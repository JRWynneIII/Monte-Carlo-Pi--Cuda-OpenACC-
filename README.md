GPU Monte Carlo (Pi)
====================

GPU accelerated C++ code that calculates pi using a Monte Carlo method. This is only GPU parallelized (not parallelized with MPI or OpenMP). There will be a version with OpenACC, CUDA, CUDA with an OpenACC reduction, and a version completely accelerated with Thrust.
